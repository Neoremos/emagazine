                                    Osamu Tezuka was a Japanese cartoonist, manga artist, and animator. Born in Osaka Prefecture, his prolific output, pioneering techniques, and innovative redefinitions of genres earned him such titles as "the God of Manga", "the Father of Manga", and "the Godfather of Manga". Additionally, he is often considered the Japanese equivalent to Walt Disney, who served as a major inspiration during Tezuka's formative years. Though this phrase praises the quality of his early comic works for children and animations, it also blurs the significant influence of his later, more literary, gekiga works.
                                    <br>
                                    Tezuka began what was known as the comic revolution in Japan with his New Treasure Island published in 1947. His output would spawn some of the most influential, successful, and well-received comic series including the children mangas Astro Boy, Princess Knight and Kimba the White Lion, and the adult-oriented series Black Jack, Phoenix, and Buddha, all of which won several awards.

                                    Before Gon departed to take the Hunter exam as the first step to achieve the ultimate goal of finding his father, Aunt Mito apologized for lying to Gon. The reason remained untold up to this point of the series, but it seems like whatever it is, Gon thinks that it isn't necessary and he knew Mito was not telling the truth that Ging abandoned him.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It's valid to argue that Ging saw the possibility of Mito taking away his kid. But letting Mito think that it's all her fault all along would be so mean of him. It's probably true that he was forced to give up Gon, and he just tried to find ways after that so his kid would want to become a Hunter and seek for him.

                                <p><em>What is the reason behind the headbands?</em></p>

                                The headbands worn by the cast of Naruto are perhaps the show's most instantly recognizable asset. Despite their high potential for merchandising, the headbands were actually introduced because the artists wanted to conserve resources.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                At the beginning of the series, Naruto is seen wearing a pair of goggles in place of a headband. As it turns out, it takes a lot longer to sketch an ornate pair of goggles than it does to draw a flat, wide headband. In an effort to save time and energy, Naruto (along with many other characters) is given a headband to wear, which makes him much easier to reproduce.

                                    The big baddies of "Attack on Titan" are muscular, athletic, and unnervingly powerful. They always look action-ready, but how exactly did Hajime Isayama come up with their beastly designs? He referenced famous fighters for many of them.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The main protagonist, Eren Yeager’s Titan form was modeled after mixed martial artist Yushin Okami, who has competed in organizations such as UFC and Pride FC. Isayama also used professional wrestler and mixed martial artist Brock Lesnar as inspiration when designing the Armored Titan.
                                    It’s fitting that "Attack on Titan’s" towering giants are inspired by world-class fighters whose main goal is to utterly destroy their opponents.
